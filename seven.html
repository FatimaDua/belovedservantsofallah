              <p>The balance we must make between this Dunya ( this temporary life ) and the Akhirah ( the hereafter ) ... and, why do some people fear death ? 
                <br><br>
                As there is a balance in this universe. As there is a perfect order for every single thing that exists here, we also must make a balance in our lives in order to maintain stable lives. 
                <br><br>
                We are brought into this vast existence to discover it and to discover ourselves too in the process; Therefore, heighten our faith [imaan] in Allah. For, as our knowledge and awareness grow larger, our faith grows stronger.
                <br><br>
                
                We are here not to hate life and keep complaining about all the trials and tribulations that keep happening to us. This is not heaven. We are in a test now, and I ask Allah that we pass this test with flying colors. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran, in Surah Al-Mulk , verse 2 : 
                <br><br>
                الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ
                <br><br>
                
                "Who created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving"
                <br><br>
                Heaven is created for those who deserve it , it is home for those who truly belong to. 
                <br><br>
                This is why we are here. Time is running and our purpose is to work for our home. In order to get there, we must first prove to Allah and prove to ourselves that we are worth it , and this proof exposes itself when the trials and harships come our way , because the goal of these trials is to shed light on our essence. When I say trials and tribulations , I don't only mean dark clouds that come over your head, but also the rainbows that make you feel like flying with unicorns in the beautiful blue clear sky. If you are wise enough, you already know that not every dark cloud is a bad thing, for it may be carrying within rain which will make you grow and bloom into a beautiful flower, and you also know that not every rainbow in the sky is actually a rainbow of happiness and relief, because it may carry behind it a really lethal storm that you may discover later on. 
                <br><br>
                What i'm trying to say is that we should be grateful no matter what happens, and always see the good in the bad and beware of what seems to be good but it may be actually bad. 
                <br><br>
                
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 216
                <br><br>

                وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۖ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ (216)
                <br><br>
                "But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not."
                <br><br>
                We are human beings, we get sad and we get angry and we get happy and so and so .. we are a complex mixture of feelings and emotions and moods, and that's totally normal, but what matters is HOW we deal with all of it. 
                <br><br>
                What matters is what we choose to do when bad things happen .. do we surrender to complaining about it all the time ? Or, do we try to see the good in the bad and get back up stronger ? 
                <br><br>
                The choice is yours. 
                <br><br>
                You either throw youself in the hellfire of your shallow perspective, or you dive into the depth of your own wisdom and see the light in the darkness and choose to let whatever happens make you a better person. 
                <br><br>
                It's during our darkest times and our happiest times that we are exposed to ourselves and to others. 
                <br><br>
                When you are happy,  don't show off. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Ankabut verse 33 :
                <br><br>
                لا تفرح إن الله لا يحب الفرحين 
                <br><br>
                "Do not exult , Allah does not like the exultant "  
                <br><br>
                Allah even gives an example of Qarun in Surah Al-Ankabut , verse 33 : 
                <br><br>
                إِنَّ قَارُونَ كَانَ مِن قَوْمِ مُوسَىٰ فَبَغَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ ۖ وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُوزِ مَا إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوءُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِي الْقُوَّةِ إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ قَوْمُهُ لَا تَفْرَحْ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَرِحِينَ
                <br><br>
                "Indeed, Qarun was from the people of Moses, but he tyrannized them. And We gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men; thereupon his people said to him, "Do not exult. Indeed, Allah does not like the exultant."
                <br><br>
                This verse as one example of so many other beautiful verses in the great book of Quran , sparks that inner fire of gratitude and thankfulness and humility inside of us to thank Allah for the greatest gift which is Islam. Allah has blessed us with Islam. For, Islam teaches us how to be better human beings. 
                <br><br>
                And when you are sad , don't grieve for too long 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Ankabut , verse 33 :
                <br><br> 
                لا تخف ولا تحزن انا منجوك
                <br><br>
                "Do not fear, nor grieve. Indeed, we will save you" 
                <br><br>
                Allah consoles us all the time. A true believer is never truly depressed. You can't be depressed while you have a faithful heart within. 
                <br><br>
                Ask yourself these two important questions : 
                <br><br>
                When good things happen , do I express gratitude and thankfulness towards Allah ? Or do I forget about him and only remember him during  hard times ? Or do I carry his presence in my heart all the time, through thick and thin ? 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Ankabut , verse 65 : 
                <br><br>
                فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ 
                <br><br>
                
                "Whenever they go on board a ship they call on God, and dedicate their faith to Him alone, but once He has delivered them safely back to land, see how they ascribe partners to Him!"
                <br><br>
                And he says in Surah Al Israa , verse 67 : 
                <br><br>
                وإذا مسكم الضر في البحر ضل من تدعون إلا إياه فلما نجاكم إلى البر أعرضتم وكان الإنسان كفورا 
                <br><br>
                "And when adversity touches you at sea, lost are [all] those you invoke except for Him. But when He delivers you to the land, you turn away [from Him]. And certainly man is ungrateful."
                <br><br>
                We must stick to Allah all the time in both bliss and sorrow. In both tears and laughters. Our happiness is complete only with Allah. We must always be grateful to Him. 
                <br><br>
                In Quran , there are so many beautiful stories. We must read them over and over and over again and learn from them.
                <br><br>
                So, all what happens, good and bad, is for our own good as it exposes who we truly are. 
                <br><br>
                Bad exists to make us recognize good and sins exist to show which of us is determined to smother the evil within and invests more in the goodness within. 
                <br><br>
                Remember, the stronger your faith is, the trials will increase in severity. 
                <br><br>
                During your roughest times, remember the prophets and so many great people like them who grew even stronger during the many trials of life. Stick to faith and let patience be your armor.
                <br><br>
                We are here not to hate life, we are here to love it and live it. But wait, when I say " not to hate life but to love it and live it " 
                <br><br>
                I don't mean to walk around recklessly and live as though you won't die someday and you just go around make a mess of your life. 
                <br><br>
                Allah orders us to live , to observe his greatness even within ourselves , and to discover more and more of it. 
                <br><br>
                And this is why Islam is brought to us, to guide us throughout life. To show us right from wrong. Because as human beings, we need guidance. We need Allah. Always. Islam guards us all the time. 
                <br><br>
                No matter how powerful we might think we are, no matter how rich we are, no matter how smart we are. All of it means nothing without taking into consideration the existence of God.
                <br><br>
                And by the existence of God. I mean not only the realization that there is a God watching us, but also realizing within ourselves that there is a serenity inside because we know Allah. To consider God's existence is to maintain a good conscience. To consider God's existence is to keep up a good heart. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran, verse 60 from Surah Al-Baqara : 
                <br><br>
                كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا مِن رِّزْقِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ
                <br><br>
                
                "Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, do not spread corruption."
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 168 :
                <br><br>
                يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ كُلُوا مِمَّا فِي الْأَرْضِ حَلَالًا طَيِّبًا وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ (168)
                <br><br>
                "O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy."
                <br><br>
                To love life is to enjoy your existence , to eat and drink but not over-indulge. To help each other and to spread love , mercy and kindness in this world. To love life is to love doing good. To love seeking good knowledge. To discover who you are, to get closer to Allah, because this life is supposed to be a journey. A journey to discover who you are and to get closer to Allah.
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 172 : 
                <br><br>
                يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُلُوا مِن طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لِلَّهِ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ (172) 
                <br><br>
                "O you who have believed, eat from the good things which we have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship."
                <br><br>
                And he says Surah A-Lail : 
                <br><br>
                إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى (4) فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى وَاتَّقَى (5) وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَى (6) فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَى (7) وَأَمَّا مَنْ بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَى (8) وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَى (9) فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى (10) وَمَا يُغْنِي عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّى (11) إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا لَلْهُدَى (12) وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلْآخِرَةَ وَالْأُولَى (13) فَأَنْذَرْتُكُمْ نَارًا تَلَظَّى (14) لَا يَصْلَاهَا إِلَّا الْأَشْقَى (15) الَّذِي كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى (16) وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الْأَتْقَى (17) الَّذِي يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّى (18) وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِنْدَهُ مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ تُجْزَى (19) إِلَّا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الْأَعْلَى (20) وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَى (21)
                <br><br>
                
                "Indeed, your efforts are diverse. As for he who gives and fears Allah and believes in the best [reward] we will ease him towards ease. But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need, and denies the best [reward] we will ease him toward difficulty. And what will his wealth avail him when he falls? Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance. And indeed, to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life]. So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing. None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one. Who had denied and turned away. But the righteous one will avoid it – [He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself. And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded, But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High. And he is going to be satisfied." 
                <br><br>
                So the choice is yours to choose which path you want to hold onto. 
                <br><br>
                And he says in Surah Qasas , verse 77 : 
                <br><br>
                وَابْتَغِ فِيمَا آتَاكَ اللَّهُ الدَّارَ الْآخِرَةَ ۖ وَلَا تَنسَ نَصِيبَكَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَأَحْسِن كَمَا أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكَ ۖ وَلَا تَبْغِ الْفَسَادَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُفْسِدِينَ (77)
                <br><br>
                "But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters."
                <br><br>
                Allah doesn't order you to stop living. On the contrary, he orders us to live and enjoy and celebrate life, but with regard to limits! And here comes the balance. 
                <br><br>
                It's okay to live, to laugh, to smile, to love, to eat and to make friendships and to do so many things in life , but we must make balance in all of these things. Simply, because Islam is a religion of balance.
                <br><br>
                It's okay to live , but we must also keep in mind that there is another life that we must work for too. Being too much involved in this temporary life and forgetting about the hereafter is not a good thing. 
                <br><br>
                The thinker Mustapha Mahmoud says :
                <br><br> 
                اتعجب تماما من ناس يجمعون ويكنزن ويبنون ويرفعون البناء وينفقون على ابهة السكن ورفاهية المقام وكأنما هو مقام ابدي واقول لنفسي : انسوا انهم في مرور ؟ الم يتذكر احدهم انه حمل نعش ابيه وغدا يحمل ابنه نعشه الى حفرة يستوي فيها الكل ولماذا هذه الابهة الفارغة ؟ ولمن ؟ ولمن الترف ونحن راحلون؟ هل نحن اغبياء الى هذه الدرجة ؟ ام هي غواشي الغرور والغفلة ؟
                <br><br>
                "I am really amazed at those people who hoard money and rush to build higher and better buildings and houses and spend their money recklessly and selfishly, on luxury, buying the best houses with expensive furniture. As if they'll live forever in this world. 
                <br><br>
                I say to myself : have they forgotten, that they are here only temporarily? 
                <br><br>
                Hasn't someone remembered that he had already carried his own father's shroud, and that tomorrow, his son will carry his into a grave where everyone is equal. 
                <br><br>
                Why strive for such an empty luxurious life? For whom ? And for whom are we doing this since we're leaving this earth? Are we stupid to this extent ? Or are we just blind by arrogance and ignorace ?"
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah At-Tawbah verse 34 : 
                <br><br>
                وَالَّذِينَ يَكْنِزُونَ الذَّهَبَ وَالْفِضَّةَ وَلَا يُنفِقُونَهَا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ فَبَشِّرْهُم بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ (34)
                <br><br>
                "And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah - give them tidings of a painful punishment."     
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Hadid verse 7 : 
                <br><br>
                آمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَأَنفِقُوا مِمَّا جَعَلَكُم مُّسْتَخْلَفِينَ فِيهِ ۖ فَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنكُمْ وَأَنفَقُوا لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ كَبِيرٌ (7)
                <br><br>
                "Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successors. For those who have believed among you and spent, there will be a great reward."
                <br><br>
                God does not order us to be greedy and live selfishly and recklessly. He orders us to free ourselves from the chains of this ignorance. 
                <br><br>
                He reminds us that no matter how much money we own, we still don't own anything. For, everything belongs to Him. 
                <br><br>
                We must spend our money wisely. Yes, it's okay to be rich financially, but spend your money wisely. Help the poor and the needy, do not be selfish and greedy. 
                <br><br>
                Remember, you will die one day , so what are you willing to leave behind ? And are you ready to meet your creator ? The one who has created this whole great existence ? Are you ready ? If yes, what have you done for yourself and for humanity so far ? If not, what are you waiting for ? The door of mercy is still open , rush to do good! 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Baqara verses 200-202 :
                <br><br> 
                فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُمْ مَنَاسِكَكُمْ فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ آبَاءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًا فَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ (200) وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَقُولُ رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ (200) أُولَئِكَ لَهُمْ نَصِيبٌ مِمَّا كَسَبُوا وَاللَّهُ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ (202)
                "And when you have completed your rites, remember Allah like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, "Our Lord, give us in this world," and he will have in the Hereafter no share.
                <br><br>
                But among them is he who says, "Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire." Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account."
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Aa'la  : 
                <br><br>
                 بَلْ تُؤْثِرُونَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا (16) وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَى (17) 
                 <br><br>
                 "But you prefer the worldy life, while the hereafter is better and more enduring"
                 <br><br>
                 So it is prudent to remember the hereafter more often, and our true home which is Heaven , while we are living and working in this temporary life. 
                 <br><br>
                 In order to live a balanced life , one must have good conscience, good character. 
                 <br><br>
                 Allah says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 205 : 
                 <br><br>
                وَإِذَا تَوَلَّىٰ سَعَىٰ فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيُفْسِدَ فِيهَا وَيُهْلِكَ الْحَرْثَ وَالنَّسْلَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفَسَادَ
                <br><br>
                "When attains authority, he rushes about the land to foment disorder and corruption therein and to ruin the sources of life and human generations. Surely God does not love disorder and corruption."
                <br><br>
                Allah doesn't like those who spread corruption. 
                <br><br>
                We must always be grateful for all that Allah has given us. Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Baqara , verse 172 : 
                <br><br>
                يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِّبَاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ وَاشْكُرُوا لِلَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ (<br><br>172)
                <br><br>
                "O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship."
                <br><br>
                Allah orders us to enjoy life , to be grateful , to have conscience , to have good manners and to always remember death and to always remember , our true home. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says about Dunya ( this life ) in Surah Yunus, verse 24 : 
                إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنْزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ النَّاسُ وَالْأَنْعَامُ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَتِ الْأَرْضُ زُخْرُفَهَا وَازَّيَّنَتْ وَظَنَّ أَهْلُهَا أَنَّهُمْ قَادِرُونَ عَلَيْهَا أَتَاهَا أَمْرُنَا لَيْلًا أَوْ نَهَارًا فَجَعَلْنَاهَا حَصِيدًا كَأَنْ لَمْ تَغْنَ بِالْأَمْسِ كَذَلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ 
                <br><br>
                "The example of [this] worldly life is but like rain which We have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth absorb - [those] from which men and livestock eat - until, when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people suppose that they have capability over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We explain in detail the signs for a people who think and reflect"
                <br><br>
                Remember, this is only a part of the journey. We are here in this life to work for the hereafter. So, we must make a balance. 
                <br><br>
                 Allah says is Surah al An'aam verse 32 : 
                 <br><br>
                 
                وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَلَلدَّارُ الْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ أَفَلَا تَعْقِلُونَ
                <br><br>
                "And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason?"
                <br><br>
                I want to discuss also the "issue" of the fear of death which some people struggle with. 
                <br><br>
                There are two types of people who fear death : 
                <br><br>
                The people who are religious to a great extent. They remember death always, they fear death because they have already realized the greatness of their creator they're going to meet sooner or later, which makes them want to do more good things in life and get closer and closer to Allah to gain His love. 
                <br><br>
                The second type of people who fear death are those who are not that religious, they are not committed to their prayers and they do not do good enough in this life, but they have a fear that one day they'll die and they won't be ready for death. 
                <br><br>
                These two kinds of people are both good, because they both still remembered their true fate. 
                <br><br>
                Fearing death is totally normal and it is also a good thing , because it shows that you are a good person. That you want to be better, so work on yourself to be a better human being, so that when death comes to you, you'll be already happy and proud to meet God with a good heart and many many of good deeds. 
                <br><br>
                So, instead of spending your whole time worrying about death, get up and invest that time in doing good deeds that'll get you closer to God. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 195 : 
                <br><br>
                وَأَنفِقُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ ۛ وَأَحْسِنُوا ۛ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُحْسِنِينَ (195)
                <br><br>
                "And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good."
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah verse 277 : 
                <br><br>
                إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ لَهُمْ أَجْرُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ (277)
                <br><br>
                "Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zakah ( charity ) will have their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve."
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 148 : 
                <br><br>
                فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ ۚ أَيْنَ مَا تَكُونُوا يَأْتِ بِكُمُ اللَّهُ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ (<br><br>148)
                <br><br>
                "So race to [all that is] good. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you forth [for judgement] all together. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Imran verse 92 : 
                <br><br>
                لَن تَنَالُوا الْبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنفِقُوا مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ ۚ وَمَا تُنفِقُوا مِن شَيْءٍ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ بِهِ عَلِيمٌ (92)
                
                <br><br>
                "Never will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of Allah ] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it."
                <br><br>
                Islam is a mercy to us. It is the perfect guide to a better life. 
                <br><br>
                Allah protects us through this priceless gift which is Islam. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Maidah : 
                <br><br>
                حُرِّمَتْ عَلَيْكُمُ الْمَيْتَةُ وَالدَّمُ وَلَحْمُ الْخِنزِيرِ وَمَا أُهِلَّ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ بِهِ وَالْمُنْخَنِقَةُ وَالْمَوْقُوذَةُ وَالْمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَالنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَا أَكَلَ السَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى النُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسْتَقْسِمُوا بِالْأَزْلَامِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ فِسْقٌ ۗ الْيَوْمَ يَئِسَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِن دِينِكُمْ فَلَا تَخْشَوْهُمْ وَاخْشَوْنِ ۚ الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا ۚ فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ فِي مَخْمَصَةٍ غَيْرَ مُتَجَانِفٍ لِّإِثْمٍ ۙ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ (3) يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَاذَا أُحِلَّ لَهُمْ ۖ قُلْ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ ۙ وَمَا عَلَّمْتُم مِّنَ الْجَوَارِحِ مُكَلِّبِينَ تُعَلِّمُونَهُنَّ مِمَّا عَلَّمَكُمُ اللَّهُ ۖ فَكُلُوا مِمَّا أَمْسَكْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَاذْكُرُوا اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ (4) الْيَوْمَ أُحِلَّ لَكُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتُ ۖ وَطَعَامُ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ حِلٌّ لَّكُمْ وَطَعَامُكُمْ حِلٌّ لَّهُمْ ۖ وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ إِذَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ مُحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ وَلَا مُتَّخِذِي أَخْدَانٍ ۗ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالْإِيمَانِ فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ (5)
                <br><br>
                "Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytatah (the dead animals - cattle-beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allah's Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal - unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars). (Forbidden) also is to use arrows seeking luck or decision, (all) that is Fisqun (disobedience of Allah and sin). This day, those who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion, so fear them not, but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above-mentioned meats), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
                <br><br>
                There are so many priceless verses in the Quran which show how priceless Islam is. 
                <br><br>
                Islam is not only a set of rules to follow and a "Haram Vs. Halal" thing. Islam is so much more than that, because Allah LOVES us and PROTECTS us and CARES for us and APPRECIATES & VALUES us. Allah sets for us these rules not to " cage " us , but to FREE us from our own ignorance. 
                <br><br>
                Islam is a gift to us , a guide to a better life. 
                <br><br>
                You want to know Islam as it truly is ? It is home. </p>
