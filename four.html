                Good manners, the Prophet and the Messenger Muhammad Peace Be Upon him is a Paragon of Kindness. <br>
                Islam is peace. It is peaceful, and with peace comes kindness which is the most beautiful quality in a human being. 
                Islam teaches people how to be kind to everybody including parents, neighbors, friends, and those who are weak and poor. 
                Islam teaches us how to take care of the poor and the orphans, and how to take care of each other and how to be good to each other, 
                as Allah says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 83: 
              </p>
              <p> وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا وَذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينِ وَقُولُوا لِلنَّاسِ حُسْنًا </p>
                "And be good to your parents and your relatives and the orphans and the needy, and say kind words to people" <br>
                And as our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says : 
                <p> 
                  "لا تحقرن من المعروف شيئا ، ولو تلقى‏ أخاك بوجه طلق" 
                </p>
                "Do not understimate any act of kindness, even if it is meeting your brother and sister with a cheerful face" <br> 
              </p> 
              <p> 
                To be a true Muslim is to be kind to everyone including yourself. 
                To be genuinely kind, without expecting anything in return.
                 For, kindness is linked to humanity and humanity is what we are living for, and this is why we are here on this earth, to be true human beings.
                Therefore, good manners include being kind. 
              </p>
                And Muhammad peace be upon him is a paragon of good manners. He is a paragon of kindness. 
              <p> 
                As Allah says about our beloved prophet Muhammad in the Quran, in Surah Al-Qalam verse 4 :
               <p> 
                 وَإِنَّكَ لَعَلَىٰ خُلُقٍ عَظِيمٍ  
               </p>
                "And indeed, you are of a great moral character"  <br>
                Allah does not praise our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him for his knowledge or his outer beauty, but he praises him for his great manners, his inner beauty, his great character. 
                This is what Allah cares about in a human being : having good manners, having a good character. 
              </p>
                <p>
                  Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says :  
                  <br>
                  <p>  
                    إن من أخيركم احسنكم اخلاقا  
                  </p>
                  "The best among you are those who have the best character" 
                </p> 
                <p>
                  This is what Islam teaches, it teaches us how to have good manners and how to build and maintain a good character and how to live by it. 
                  Those manners include all the rules that Allah states in the Quran and what Muhammad says in his Ahadith or Sunnah.
                  Everything that Allah and his messenger allow us to do and everything that Allah and his messenger warn us about and order us not to do. Everything is only for our own good, because Allah and His messenger have great love for us. 
                  Islam has come to us to save us from our own darkness which is ignorance and our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is the best way through which we know who Allah truly is. For, our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him has always been known as the greatest man who has ever lived and we shall listen to him and follow his wise Sunnah. 
                  As Allah says in Surah Al-Anfal verse 46 :
                </p>
                <p>
                   وَأَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ ورَسُولَهُ ولا تَنازَعُوا فَتَفْشَلُوا وتَذْهَبَ رِيحُكُمْ واصْبِرُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    "And obey Allah and His messenger, and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient."
                    Muhammad is a paragon of humanity. 
                     <br>
                    He is the genuinely kind-hearted, for he says :  
                    <br>
                  <p>   
                    الكَلِمَةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ صَدَقَةٌ  
                  </p> 
                  "A kind word is an act of charity"  
                  <br>
                   He also says : 
                </p>
                <p> 
                  اتَّقُوا النَّارَ وَلَوْ بِشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ، فَمَنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ فَبِكَلِمَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ 
                </p> 
                <br>
                "Fear the hellfire, even by giving a single date. If you do not find a date, then by saying a kind word"  
                <br>
                Muhammad is the helper, the understanding, the truthful, the wise and the honest. He says : 
                <p> من نفس عن مؤمن كربة من كرب الدنيا نفس الله عنه كربة من كرب يوم القيامة،
                   ومن يسر على معسر يسر الله عليه في الدنيا والآخرة،
                  ومن ستر مسلماً ستره الله في الدنيا والآخرة، والله في عون العبد ما كان العبد في عون أخيه.
                </p> 
                "Whoever relieves a believer from a calamity of the calamities of this world, Allah will surely relieve him or her from a calamity of the calamities in the hereafter. And whoever makes it easy for someone who faces a difficult time, Allah will make it easy for him or her in both this world and in the hereafter. And whoever preserves a Muslim, Allah will be preserve him or her in this world and in the hereafter. Verily, Allah always helps his beloved servants as long as his servants are always helping their brothers and sisters" 
               <p>
                 Muhammad is self-discipline in human form. As he says :  
                 <br>
                <p> 
                  "The greatest Jihad is to battle your own soul, to fight the evil within yourself." 
                </p>
                And Ali Bnu Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, says : 
                 <br> 
                 <br>
                <p>
                 ميدانكم نفوسكم  <br>
                  فإن انتصرتم عليها  <br>
                  كنتم على غيرها اقدر،  <br>
                  وإن خذلتم فيها  <br>
                  كنتم على غيرها أعجز  <br>
                  فجربوا معها الكفاح أولا <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Your battle field is your own selves  <br>
                  If you win the battle within yourselves  <br>
                  You will be able to win anything else,  <br>
                  And if you didn't win the battle within yourselves  <br>
                  You won't be able to defeat anything else  <br>
                  So, try to resist and fight your own selves first"  <br>
               </p> 
                To battle your own soul is to battle your own evil, to smother your own evil. 
                Not to hurt others when you are angry. Not to wish bad to others .. and so on. 
                Indeed, Islam teaches us so many beautiful manners.  <br>
              <p> 
                Allah in the Quran orders us to pray regularly and never skip a single prayer. In the Quran, prayer and patience and good manners are mentioned several times, because they are so important to us. 
                Prayer keeps us in continuous connection with Allah and it keeps us clean on both the external and the internal sides. 
                Allah says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 45 :  <br>
              </p>
               <p>
                  وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ 
                </p>
                "And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah]"  <br>
                Sincere devotion to Allah or humble submission or خشوع happens when we pray with sincerity. Trust me, once you taste the sweetness of this humble submission to Allah. Once you taste the sweetness of a strong and an unshakable faith in Allah, you will prosper and you will never even imagine yourself not having this strong faith in Allah, because with Allah, you are safe, you are home. 
                Besides this, good manners include practising what we preach.  <br>
                As Allah says in Surah As-saf verse 2-3 :  
                <p>
                  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لِمَ تَقُولُونَ مَا لَا تَفْعَلُونَ (2) كَبُرَ مَقْتًا عِنْدَ اللَّهِ أَنْ تَقُولُوا مَا لا تَفْعَلُونَ (3)  <br> 
                </p>
                "O believers, why do you say what you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do"   <br>
                Allah also orders us to be just. He says in Surah Al-A'raf verse 181  :  <br> 
                <p> 
                   وَمِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ <br> 
                </p>
                "And among those We created is a community which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice" 
                Islam teaches Justice.  <br>
                Allah orders us to be better human beings through being good to each other and obeying and fearing Allah the right way.
                He says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 41 :  <br> 
                <p> 
                   وَإِيَّايَ فَاتَّقُونِ <br> 
                </p>
                "And fear [only] me"  <br> 
                And also says in Surah Al-Baqara verse 194 :  <br> 
                <p>
                  وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الْمُتَّقِينَ <br> 
                </p>
                "And fear Allah and know that Allah is with those who fear Him"  <br>
                Allah here says these words in order to spark that fire of conscience that we have, that conscience is a good quality and that a human with conscience is a good human being.  <br>
                Allah also orders us to stick to him, always, and to stick to what is right and to stick with each other as human beings, thus guiding each other towards Allah's great mercy. Allah says in Surah Ali 'imran verses 103-105 :<br> 
                <p>
                   وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً ولا تَفَرَّقُوا واذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْداءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُمْ بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْواناً وكُنْتُمْ عَلى شَفا حُفْرَةٍ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْها كَذلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آياتهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ (103) ولْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ ويَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ويَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وأُولئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ (104) ولا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا واخْتَلَفُوا مِنْ بَعْدِ ما جاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّناتُ وأُولئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذابٌ عَظِيم ٌ(105) 
                </p>
                <p>
                  "And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. 
                  And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together 
                  and you became, by His favor, brothers. 
                  And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, 
                  and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided (103) 
                  And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, 
                  enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful (104) 
                  And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. 
                  And those will have a great punishment (105)"
                </p> 
                <p>
                  And let's not deny that no matter how blind we may be at times and no matter how many times the truth is concealed, 
                  we will always turn to Allah, because in spite of everything, we deeply believe that we are not alone on this earth 
                  and that even during times when everything is uncertain, Allah is our certainty. 
                  That there is Allah, the merciful God. 
                  As He says in Surah Ar-rum verse 30 : 
               </p>
                <p>
                 فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا ۚ فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا ۚ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ (30)
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                  "(O Prophet and his followers), turn your face singlemindedly to the true Faith and adhere to the true nature on which Allah has created human beings. The creation of Allah cannot be altered. 
                  That is the True, Straight Faith, although most people do not know."
                </p>
                This only shows that we, as human beings, will always be in desperate need for Allah. We can't be brought into this vast existence without guidance. And it is even in our nature that we always seek Allah.  <br>
                Islam, dear reader, teaches us not only kindness, humility, modesty, honesty, justice and all sorts of good manners, Islam also teaches us love and what is even more beyond love, it teaches us mercy.  <br>
                As Allah says in Surah Ar-rum verse 21 :  <br> 
                <p>
                  وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً 
                </p> <br>
                "And He placed between you affection and mercy"  <br>
                Islam teaches us to be merciful and loving towards each other and it teaches us also the unconditional love of Allah towards us and his infinite mercy to us all. Allah says in Surah Az-zumar verse 53  : 
                <p>
                 قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ  <br> 
                </p>
                "Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah . 
                Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. 
                Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
                <p> 
                  Islam teaches peace, it teaches good manners, it teaches character, it teaches mercy, it teaches humanity, it teaches truth. <br>
                  There are so many more priceless verses in the Quran which you can look for and read and benefit from. <br>
                  If only we, open our eyes, then the truth would show itself and it would be crystal clear, and, it is already clear.  <br> 
                </p>
