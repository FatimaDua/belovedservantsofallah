              <p>Why isolation is important ... when there is no way out and all the doors are closed, faith makes different ways and opens several doors.
                <br><br>
                The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, very often had time for isolation. He isolated himself in the cave of Hira, worshipping Allah, meditating, observing, and wondering about certain things, things that actually mattered. 
                <br><br>
                In the cave of Hira , the angel Gibreel came to our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him to deliver the revelation of the Quran or الوحي , and there the story of the prophecy of our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him with Islam began .. 
                <br><br>
                Some of the greatest people in the world spend most of their time in solitude, a positive solitude wherein they connect with themselves on a deeper level. They make a balance however; They make time for themselves, for solitude, and they make time for interacting with people and their loved ones as well.
                <br><br>
                Maryam, may Allah be pleased with her, the mother of Jesus, had her time in solitude. She suffered alone, but she remained strong and had strong faith in Allah. 
                <br><br>
                Through the angel Gibreel, Allah consoled Maryam during that hard time of her pregnancy, and he said to her in Surah Maryam verse 24 : 
                <br><br>
                فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَا أَلَّا تَحْزَنِي 
                <br><br>
                "And He [Gibreel] called her from below her, 'Do not grieve' "
                <br><br>
                Hajar too, may Allah be pleased with her, when she was looking for water. 
                <br><br>
                Hajar, may Allah be pleased with her, the wife of the prophet Ibrahim and the mother of Ishmael, may Allah be pleased with them, when she followed her husband Ibrahim after he had left her with their son Ishmael in an empty dry desert. Ibrahim heard Hajar saying as he walked away : " O Ibrahim, where are you going ? Why are you leaving us alone in such empty place ? " 
                <br><br>
                Ibrahim, however, did not turn around to his wife. Then, she said : " has Allah ordered you to do that ? " 
                <br><br>
                Then, Ibrahim replied : " yes." 
                <br><br>
                Then, Hajar said : " then, Allah won't ever let us down! " 
                <br><br>
                Yes, Allah never lets down His beloved good servants.
                <br><br>
                Joseph or Yusuf, may Allah be pleased with him, also had some time in solitude, praying to Allah and getting warm consolation from feeling the presence of Allah with him during his roughest times. Jesus also had his time in solitude. Jonas or Yunus, may Allah be pleased with him, also experienced solitude under three levels of darkness : the darkness inside the whale's belly, the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the night. However, in spite of all these three levels of darkness, he had strong faith in Allah's mercy. 
                <br><br>
                All of these great people and so many more others like them , experienced solitude on different levels. 
                <br><br>
                But they all meet each other in one point which is maintaining that strong faith in Allah. 
                <br><br>
                Some people spend most of their time in solitude, because they know that there is something not right in the world around them. They find that their only consolation is being closer to Allah to keep them sane and to help them strengthen their faith in him and help them make a better change within themselves and around them in the world.
                <br><br>
                Asia bintu Muzahim, the wife of Firaoun, also had her time in solitude. For, she confronted her own husband and stood against his tyranny, injustice and cruelty, fearing none but Allah. She stood up for justice, and what kept her strong and steady was her strong faith in Allah. So, she didn't care if she lost her own life for the sake of Allah, for the sake of justice and humanity, for the sake of truth. 
                <br><br>
                Asia was alone. No one dared to stand up for justice except her. When almost everyone was afraid of Firaoun, she was not. She was alone, but she was not really alone, because Allah was with her. 
                <br><br>
                Why don't we be like them ? You think that the time of injustice ended ? No, it's still going on and it's even getting worse. 
                <br><br>
                We must fight against this injustice and cruelty we see everyday in this world. We must be just with ourselves, just in our homes, just with our parents and kids and siblings and relatives. We must be just with our friends and everyone else. Justice must run deep in our blood. We must breathe justice. We must stick to our strong faith in Allah and fight for justice everywhere. 
                <br><br>
                We belong to our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, we must save our world and our Ummah (nation), because we have so many enemies who want to bring us down. There are so many enemies who kill our brothers and sisters in humanity and in Islam everyday. We must wake up from our own ignorance! 
                <br><br>
                We belong to the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him who used to spend most of the time in solitude trying to figure out life and find the solutions to convince the people of that time to stop worshipping those useless idols which people at that time considered them to be Gods, and that was totally wrong. 
                <br><br>
                We must do the same, to wake people up from worshipping their own ignorance. People of this time must wake up from this lethal ignorance they are worshipping. An ignorance that is dragging them down to hell. An ignorance that is dragging them down to the filth of inhumanity and weak conscience. 
                <br><br>
                Most of the people at this time must wake up from their cruelty against themselves and against others. Must wake up from always being mentally and spiritually asleep, not bothering themselves to think, to read, to reflect, to observe, to do something beneficial. To make things better, to educate our minds and fill them up with good knowledge, and to stand up for justice. Get up! And flourish, spiritually, mentally, and physically.
                <br><br>
                Most of the people of this time are so lost in their own ignorance, they are so brainwashed and indoctrinated. 
                <br><br>
                Where is our strong faith in Allah ?
                <br><br>
                The situation of the world and of our Ummah now is devastating. Most of the people who call themselves " muslims " are ruining this beautiful civilization day by day with their own hands, with their own evil which is IGNORANCE. 
                <br><br>
                The whole world is in darkness, it needs the light of Islam. Our Ummah too needs the light of Islam. Our Ummah needs to go back to life again. 
                <br><br>
                When we truly know Islam and live by it, the world will definitely then, know peace and justice. 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith really strong ? Is our trust in Allah really that strong ? If so , what have we done for this world ? What better changes have we made so far in ourselves and in our surroundings ? What good examples have we set for others ? What are we doing right now ? What are we DOING ? 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith as strong as Jonas's who prayed to God wholheartedly inside the belly of the whale ?
                <br><br>
                Imagine if all people take solitude as a habit in their daily lives, their whole lives will change for the better. 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith as strong as Maryam's who faced everyone and didn't care about what people would say about her because she knew she was a pure woman and she knew that she was doing the right thing and that Allah was with her ? 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith as strong as Hajar's who didn't give up ? 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith as strong as Asia, the wife of Firaoun, who stood against injustice ? 
                <br><br>
                Is our faith that strong to rely on the power of Allah, the power of faith, and plant it inside our souls in order to bloom endless flowers with heavenly fragrance of justice, kindness, peace, and mercy ?
                <br><br>
                Is our faith as strong as the prophet Muhammad's, peace be upon him, who stood against all odds ?
                <br><br>
                Is our faith that strong ?
                <br><br>
                Faith is not only to believe in Allah and in Islam. Faith is not only being and saying, it's doing. Faith is to follow your worship of Allah and your strong belief in Islam with WORK. To do something about it. To be an example of a Muslim and show people what Islam is truly is. This what faith is truly is.
                <br><br>
                Most people nowadays are ruining themselves with their weak faith. Those who don't know Allah know nothing. Those who know Allah too little, know too little. Those who know Allah well, know everything.
                <br><br>
                There are people who fear solitude, who fear spending time with themselves, and let us not mention those who fear death, it's a whole other story and I will discuss it inshaAllah in the next part which is part 7. Anyway, it's an issue that there are people who fear spending time with themselves. This issue would never be solved if they still refuse the idea of spending time with themselves. They must face it. 
                <br><br>
                Isolation or solitude is important to strengthen your relationship with Allah and with yourself.
                <br><br>
                Omar bnu abi-Al khattab said :
                <br><br>

                خذوا بحظكم من العزلة
                <br><br>
                "Have your share of solitude" 
                <br><br>
                Al Foddail said : 
                <br><br>

                مَنِ اسْتَوْحَشَ مِنَ الْوِحْدَةِ، وَاسْتَأْنَسَ بِالنَّاسِ، لَمْ يَسْلَمْ مِنَ الرِّيَاءِ. 
                <br><br>
                
                "Whoever feels a terrifying loneliness when he or she is alone, but feels consoled and safe only when he or she is with people, then hypocrisy won't leave this person." 
                <br><br>
                Al Aouzaai said :
                <br><br> 
                الْعَافِيَةُ عَشَرَةُ أَجْزَاءٍ: تِسْعَةُ أَجْزَاءٍ مِنْهَا صَمْتٌ، وَجُزْءٌ مِنْهَا اعْتِزَالُكَ عَنِ النَّاسِ.
                <br><br>
                "Wellness consists of ten parts : nine parts of it are in silence, and one part of it is in isolation." 
                <br><br>
                ASoumait bnu Ajlan said : 
                <br><br>
                إِنَّ اللَّهَ، تَعَالَى، وَسَمَ الدُّنْيَا بِالْوَحْشَةِ، لِيَكُونَ أُنْسَ الْمُطِيعِينَ بِهِ. 
                <br><br>
                "Allah describes this Dunya ( this world ) as a lonely place to be in, so that His beloved good servants won't feel home with anyone and anything else except with Him." 
                <br><br>
                Malik bnu Dinar said : 
                <br><br>
                كَانَ الأَبْرَارُ يَتَوَاصَوْنَ بِثَلاثٍ: بِسَجْنِ اللِّسَانِ، وَكَثْرَةِ الاسْتِغْفَارِ، وَالْعُزْلَةِ.
                <br><br>
                "Righteous people always advised each other with three things : smother your tongue [ don't talk nonesense, don't talk just for the sake of talking, don't backbite people and so on], seek the forgiveness of Allah more often, and spend time in isolation" 
                <br><br>
                Ibn Monabbih said : 
                <br><br>
                الْمُؤْمِنُ يُخَالِطُ لِيَعْلَمَ، وَيَسْكُتُ لِيَسْلَمَ، وَيَتَكَلَّمُ لِيَفْهَمَ، وَيَخْلُو لِيَغْنَمَ.
                <br><br>
                "The believer sits in groups of people in order to get knowledge, stays silent in order to be safe, speaks in order understand, and spends time in isolation in order to recharge and to enrich the soul, the mind and the heart" 
                <br><br>
                Isolation is important to strengthen your faith in Allah. 
                <br><br>
                Where would we find consolation if we don't find with being with Allah ? 
                <br><br>
                Foddail bnu Ojlan said : 
                <br><br>
                مَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَأْنِسْ بِالْقُرْآنِ، فَلا آنَسَ اللَّهُ وَحْشَتَهُ.
                <br><br>
                "Whoever does not find consolation in the Quran, Allah won't let him or her find consolation anywhere else" 
                <br><br>
                Isolation is important to get closer to Allah. Isolation is important to feel and observe what is within you and what is around you. Isolation is important to think about things that matter including your inner self and the world around you. Isolation is important to make you grow, to make you mature, to make you wise, to make you strong within, to make you smart, to make you rise above the ordinary.
                <br><br>
                I remember the story of the Egyptian Muslim, Doctor, thinker, and writer Mustapha Mahmoud who spent almost three years in isolation. But, he didn't choose it, it was imposed on him. For, he was sick and therefore, had to stay in bed for a limited period of time. During his time of isolation, as he said in one of his interviews on youtube, he read lots of literary books. He read the World Literature including English literature, French literature, Arabic literature and so on. His time in isolation, he said, made him the person he was after he had had recovered from illness. Mustapha Mahmoud then became a great writer, thinker and philosopher. 
                <br><br>
                This what happens when a person with good manners and a clever mind reads books and spends quality time in a positive solitude in order to grow mentally and spiritually. 
                <br><br>
                I advise you to read his great books and watch his awesome lectures on youtube. 
                <br><br>
                Dear readers, it's our duty to make things better and stand for justice. How could someone fight the external enemy if they are not ready to fight and make peace with their internal enemy and smother it from acting ill ? 
                <br><br>
                The first step towards success is to awaken our brains and read. For, the first word the angel Gibreel said to our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was " read إقرأ " 
                <br><br>
                Read and read and read and get closer to Allah and improve your character. Save yourself from ignorance. 
                <br><br>
                Gibreel met the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him with a genuine smile. 
                <br><br>
                A genuine smile could change someone's day for the better. 
                <br><br>
                Teach yourself and teach others Islam. 
                <br><br>
                The history of Islam is so full of goodness and is so rich with plenty of good information. 
                <br><br>
                Read about your Deen and be proud that you belong to Allah and be proud of your humanity.
                <br><br>
                The first step towards success is to battle the enemy within yourself. </p>
