                The relationship between women and men and why our societies have become so backward, degenerate, and miserable. 
                <br><br>
                Allah has created both men and women in order to complete each other and not compete with each other. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Ar-Rum verse 21 : 
                <br><br>
                وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُم مَّوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً
                <br><br>
                "And He placed between you affection and mercy"  
                <br><br>
                Allah orders women and men to stand together and respect one another. 
                <br><br>
                Before any feminism movements or any of this nonesense we keep hearing about nowadays.
                <br><br>
                Women in Islam were and still free and dignified and deeply appreciated. 
                <br><br>
                Before Islam, women used to get buried just because they were women. For, it was considered a shame back then to be a woman. Then, Islam came and freed women from all forms of cruelty and injustice. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in the Quran addressing men, in Surah An-Nisa verse 19 : 
                <br><br>
                وعاشروهن بالمعروف 
                "And be good to women"
                <br><br>
                Which means, treat your women well, respect them, love them and be kind to them.
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says about women : 

                <br><br>
                النساء شقائق الرجال 
                <br><br>
                "Women are men's sisters" 
                <br><br>
                And he says : 
                <br><br>
                واستوصوا بالنساء خيرا 
                <br><br>
                "Treat women kindly" 
                <br><br>
                And he says : 
                <br><br>
                لا تكرهوا البنات انهن المؤنسات الغاليات
                <br><br> 
                "Do not hate girls, they are the precious consolers" 
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him always cared for women as he cared for all human beings and treated everyone with kindness and justice. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says about our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, in Surah Al-Anbya verse 107 : 
                وما أرسلناك إلا رحمة للعالمين 
                <br><br>
                "And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds."
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him came to save all human beings from the darkness of ignorance and introduced them to the light of the true guidance which is Islam.
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, being a prophet and a leader of an Ummah ( a nation ), he also helped his wives in the kitchen and the house chores. 
                <br><br>
                His wife Aicha peace be upon her says : 
                <br><br>
                كان الرسول صلى الله عليه وسلم شديد العناية بالنساء، وأدل دليل على ذلك ما ورد في وصيته بهن وبالعناية بحقوقهن والإحسان إليهن في حجة الوداع؛ حين قال: فاتقوا الله في النساء فإنكم أخذتموهن بأمان الله. 
                <br><br>
                "The prophet Muhammad peace be upon him cared a lot about women, and the best proof was his commandments on women during his final sermon in the farewell Pilrimage. Those commandments include taking good care of women and taking care of their rights. He said , addressing men, ' Fear Allah, be conscious of Allah with regards to women and the rights of women. For, you have taken them with the protection of Allah." 
                Aicha, may Allah be pleased with her, also says :
                <br><br>
                "كان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يخصف نعله، ويخيط ثوبه، ويعمل في بيته كما يعمل أحدكم في بيته”
                
                <br><br>
                "The prophet peace be upon him, used to repair his own shoes, sew his own clothes, and he also did the house chores as you people do your house chores." 
                <br><br>
                The Egyptian thinker Mustapha Mahmoud says about our beloved prophet Muhammad in his book : Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him : 
                <br><br>
                "فتذكر ان محمدا صعد إلى السماء السابعة ووصل الى سدرة المنتهى وإقترب حيث لم يقترب مخلوقا من قبل، ولما عاد إلى الأرض كان في خدمة أهله. كان يحلب شاته، ويخصف نعله، ويأتي العبد يطلب ان يتوسط له عند سيده فيفعل، وتأتي الجارية الصغيرة تجره من يده ليشفع لها عند اهلها فيمضي معها.
                صعد الى السماء السابعة وبقي يأكل في صحن واحد مع المساكين، ويركب بغله، ويأمر جيشه أن لا يقطعوا شجرا ولا يقتلوا طفلا ولا امرأة، وأن يتركوا الرهبان في اديرتهم هم وما يعبدون.
                كان كبيرا قبل ان يصعد ، وظل كبيرا بعد ان نزل. كبيرا دون تكبر، عظيما دون تعاظم."
                <br><br>
                "And remember, that Muhammad ascended to the seventh sky and he reached the Lote Tree of the Utmost boundary. He were at a place no creature had ever been to before. And when he went back home, on earth, he served his people. He milked his own ewe and he repaired his own shoes. In addition to that, when a servant came to the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and asked him to come in between him (the servant) and his master, the prophet Muhammad would do that. And When a young maid came to him and pulled the prophet Muhammad's hand in order to take him with her to ask forgiveness from her family on her behalf, he would go with her and ask for forgiveness on her behalf. 
                <br><br>
                He ascended to the seventh sky and he still ate from one dish with the poor and the needy, rode his mule, and ordered his army not to cut trees and not to kill babies and women, and to leave the monks alone in their temples with whatever idols they worshipped. Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was great before he had ascended to the seventh sky, and he remained great when he went back down. He was great without arrogance. He was great without being boastful." 
                <br><br>
                
                Yes. This is the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. 
                <br><br>
                Islam has given women the right to live, the right to read and seek knowledge, the right to study and the right to work, and the right to choose her future husband. Above all of that, Islam appreciates women so much that it's forbidden [Haram] for her to marry a non-Muslim, because Allah knows what damages may happen if she ever marries a non-Muslim. 
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says : 
                <br><br>
                اذا اتاكم من ترضون خلقة ودينه فزوجوه 
                <br><br>
                "If a man whose character and whose relationship with Allah please you, then let him get married" 
                <br><br>
                Woman in Islam is so appreciated that she deserves to marry a Muslim like her. Why Muslim ? Because Islam is the light in the darkness and a Muslim will help her get closer to Allah and build a good future together. " a married couple who pray together, stay together."
                Islam does not stop here, because women and men are both appreciated in Islam. Simply because, Islam is a religion of justice and not equality. Both men and women have their rights and obligations and each one of them has a specific and an important role to play in society.
                Allah says in Surah Al-Ahzab verse 35 :
                <br><br> 
                إِنَّ الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَالْمُسْلِمَاتِ وَالْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَالْقَانِتِينَ وَالْقَانِتَاتِ وَالصَّادِقِينَ وَالصَّادِقَاتِ وَالصَّابِرِينَ وَالصَّابِرَاتِ وَالْخَاشِعِينَ وَالْخَاشِعَاتِ وَالْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ وَالْمُتَصَدِّقَاتِ وَالصَّائِمِينَ وَالصَّائِمَاتِ وَالْحَافِظِينَ فُرُوجَهُمْ وَالْحَافِظَاتِ وَالذَّاكِرِينَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَالذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا
                <br><br>
                "Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward."
                
                <br><br>
                Islam gives women freedom. Freedom to grow their knowledge, to think for themselves and make their own decisions based on Allah's merciful rules to all humanity. 
                <br><br>
                In Islam, we are free, we are protected, and we are appreciated. 
                <br><br>
                Sisters, don't let the Western societies fool you. Your femininity and beauty are in your strong values, your good manners, your Deen and your good shyness and modesty حياء. Your beauty is in your good education and wisdom and your beautiful heart and your strong personality.  
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, what we see today is a whole different thing. People nowadays, the great majority, have abandoned their principles and became slaves to their own selfishness and ignorance. 
                <br><br>
                How ironic it is! They run away from what they assume to be " shackles " of religion and they surrender and submit themselves to the materialistic world which has become their new religion. They have become faithful slaves to this materialistic world that their morals vanished. They're drown in laziness, severe depression, constant worry and unexcusable  phobia from themselves and from others. But they won't admit the fact that this makes them miserable.
                <br><br>
                When Islam came, it shed light on a horrid reality that people used to live in. Islam fixed many damages, but now most of the people abandoned it or at least are not taking it seriously. They rebelled against truth just to follow a tremendous lie that is disguised as truth. But a lie is a lie no matter how true or beautiful it may seem at the beginning. Unfortunately, this ugly truth has a model face, and this is why most believe it, follow it blindly, worship it and let it destroy them and play with them the way it wants. 
                <br><br>
                And then, they blame Islam, whereas Islam has nothing to do with their own ignorance. 
                <br><br>
                Doctor Eyad Al-Qunaibi says : 
                <br><br>
                العجيب في الموضوع اننا ابتعدنا عن الإسلام في حياتنا فنتج عن ذلك علاقات مشوهة ومشاكل ثم صار البعض يحاكم الإسلام وكأنه أنتج هذه المشاكل التي ما نتجت إلا عن تغييبه
                <br><br>
                "What is strange is that, we have abandoned Islam. As a result, problems arose and deformed relationships appeared. Then, some people judge Islam as if Islam is the reason of the issues which appeared. Not realizing that those issues exist because Islam is absent and not practised in our daily lives" 
                <br><br>
                
                Allah says about this kind of people in Surah Al-Furqan verse 44 : 
                <br><br>
                أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ ۖ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا (44)
                <br><br>
                "Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way."
                <br><br>
                This easy life that most have chosen is only leading them to total self-destruction. 
                <br><br>
                Abu Bakr said : 
                لا خير في خير بعده نار، ولا شرّ في شرّ بعده الجنة.
                <br><br>
                "There is no goodness in a goodness that results in going to hellfire, and there is no evil in an evil which results in going to heaven" 
                <br><br>
                Abu Bakr here teaches us wisdom, to know that what seems to be good may be bad to us and what seems to be bad may have lots of good to us. But we are living in a time when most of the people are not aware of this. 
                <br><br>
                Because of this horrid reality, Mustapha Mahmoud says in his book : Era of Monkeys : 
                نحن قادمون على عصر القرود ، فبرغم هذا الكم من التكنولوجيا التي وصل اليها الإنسان، الا اننا اصبحنا أمام إنسان أقل رحمة، أقل مودة، أقل عطفا، أقل شهامة، أقل مروءة، وأقل صفاء من الإنسان المتخلف.
                <br><br>
                "We are coming to an Era of Monkeys. In spite of this great technological success that human beings have achieved, we have become in front of a human that is less merciful, less affectionate, less tender. A human that lacks chivalry and magnanimity. We are now in front of a human being that is less purer at heart than the backward human being." 
                And this what happens when people run from the truth, from Allah. 
                <br><br>
                However, I have good news for you, which you probably know too, in spite of all the corruption we see today, Islam is still standing and us, so many Muslims around the world are still standing and we will always be standing together. We'll always stand up for what is right. Giving up is not for us. You think that Allah sparks that flame of faith inside of you just because ? No, it's because He knows that one day and this day will certainly come, we'll win. Guess what ? We're already winning.
                <br><br>
                Let us stay optimistic and let us wait for the better days while we work and prepare for them. 
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says :
                <br><br> 
                احب الفأل الصالح 
                "I love good positivity" 
                <br><br>
                So, let's have a positive mindset and maintain it. Better days are coming for sure and the flower of Islam will always be blooming. 
                <br><br>
                Islam is like a palm tree, so high in dignity and so great in solemnity. So strong and so patient, and we, Muslims, are its naturally sweet and healthy dates. Let's always spread our sweetness wherever we go.
                Allah says in the Quran in Surah As-saf verse 8 : 
                <br><br>
                يُرِيدُونَ لِيُطْفِئُوا نُورَ اللَّهِ بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَاللَّهُ مُتِمُّ نُورِهِ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ (8)
                <br><br>
                "They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it."
                <br><br>
                So, the majority of people ran away from what they assumed to be wrong and a lie. They ran from the light of truth to an abyss of darkness, a lie. They have become so far from God, the one and the only God of the this whole universe, and they followed their own hell. The hell of an easy life. 
                This what has made the world so degenerate. Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al-Baqara verse 60 :
                <br><br> 
                 كُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا مِن رِّزْقِ اللَّهِ وَلَا تَعْثَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ مُفْسِدِينَ (60)
                 <br><br>
                 "Eat and drink from the provision of Allah, and do not commit abuse on the earth, do not spread corruption."
                 <br><br>
                 
                 He orders us to do good on this earth and not corrupt it. But, just look around you, the amount of corruption that is spread in the world is terrifying and it's all because people are deprived of their principles and morals and are lost in an abyss of horrid corruption in many fields. 
                Muhammad Al-bachir Al-ibrahimi said : 
                <br><br>
                امتكم ما سقطت هذه السقطة الشنيعة من نقص في العلم ولكن من نقص في الاخلاق. 
                <br><br>
                "Your nation did not fall terribly due to a lack of knowledge, it fell due to a lack of good manners" 
                <br><br>
                This says it all! It's the lack of manners that has corrupted the whole world. 
                <br><br>
                Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says : 
                «إنّ من خياركم أحاسنكم أخلاقا»
                <br><br>
                "The best among you are those who have the best character" 
                <br><br>
                Exactly, it's all about good manners, it's all about having character. 
                <br><br>
                And this is why our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is sent to us. As he says : 
                <br><br>
                "إنمّا بُعثت لأُتمّم مكارم الأخلاق"
                <br><br>
                "I was sent to uphold and complement ethical values" 
                <br><br>
                He came to us to teach us good manners and morals, to teach us what Islam is truly is. 
                <br><br>
                This is why Islam is the absolute truth, because it protects us and it keeps us sane in a world that is often insane. 
                <br><br>
                Ali bnu-abi Talib said : 
                <br><br>
                إن المكارم أخلاق مطهرة
                فَالدِّيْنُ أَوَّلُها والعَقْلُ ثَانِيها وَالعِلْمُ ثالِثُها وَالحِلْمُ رابِعُها والجود خامِسُها والفضل سادِيها والبر سابعها والصبر ثامنها والشُّكرُ تاسِعُها واللِّين باقِيها والنفس تعلم أني لا أصادقها ولست أرشد إلا حين أعصيها. 
                <br><br>
                "Morals values are pure manners. Religion [Islam] comes first, then comes the mind. Then knowledge, then self-control, then generosity, then favor, then righteousness, then patience, then thankfulness, and then the softness of heart is what maintains all of them. Indeed, my self knows that I don't befriend it. I only become wise when I do not let it control me." 
                <br><br>
                Just observe, carefully, these precious words, precious moral values and their perfect order. 
                <br><br>
                Indeed! How blind he who does not see the pure beauty of Islam.
                <br><br>
                Mustapha Mahmoud was right when he said : 
                <br><br>
                الإسلام هو الحل، ولكن ليس الإسلام الشكلي ولا التدين المظهري، وإنما الإسلام في حقيقته وجوهره، اسلام العلم والعمل ومكارم الأخلاق.
                <br><br>
                "Islam is the solution. But, not the appearance of it nor the fake righteousness. It is the true Islam, the essence of it. The Islam of good knowledge, practice, and moral values." 
                <br><br>
                This is what our societies now lack.
                <br><br>
                People don't want to do what is right, because the right path is a hard road to walk. It takes inner strength, it takes a strong faith, it takes a thinking mind, it takes patience, it takes a sincere heart and a determined mind and a strong will, it takes a self-disciplined human being. The road of truth, or the right path is not for everyone, it's for those who truly know, who truly see not only with their eyes, but with their souls whose not consumed by this shallow materialistic world. 
                <br><br>
                Hassan Al-basri was right when he said : 
                <br><br>
                لكل أمة وثن، وصنم هذه الامة الدرهم والدينار. 
                <br><br>
                "Every nation has a deity. And the deity of this nation is money" 
                <br><br>
                Almost everyone is worshipping money today. Don't get me wrong, money is important of course, but it is only a means. When money becomes your God, then you're already lost. 
                <br><br>
                Not only money that they worship, it's their own ignorance and superficiality too. 
                <br><br>
                The reason why most of people don't choose the right path is that they want what is easy and they don't want what is right. 
                <br><br>
                When people give up patience , they give up their faith. 
                <br><br>
                
                Abdu llah bnu massoud said : 
                الصبر نصف الايمان.
                <br><br>
                "Patience is half the battle"
                <br><br>
                And our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was right when he said :
                 <br><br>
                يأتي زمان على امتي القابض على دينه كالقابض على الجمر 
                <br><br>
                "There will come a time upon my nation, the believer who holds onto his or her religion is like a person who holds onto a hot coal" 
                <br><br>
                Indeed, it is never easy, but it is what is right. 
                <br><br>
                And when you deeply believe in what is right, you stick to it in spite of everything. This is the power of belief, it rises you above the mediocrity and the filth and the superficiality of the materialistic world. 
                <br><br>
                Mankind now is in danger, it yields nothing but total and continuous desolation, all because of its own negative obstinacy and blindness. 
                <br><br>
                Sayyid Qutb in his book Milestones, says : 
                <br><br>
                "تقف البشرية اليوم على حافة الهاوية .. لا بسبب التهديد بالفناء المعلق على رأسها .. فهذا عرض للمرض وليس هو المرض .. ولكن بسبب إفلاسها في عالم *القيم* التي يمكن للحياة الإنسانية ان تنموا في ظلالها نموا سليما وتترقى ترقيا صحيحا .. وهذا واضح كل الوضوح في العالم الغربي، الذي لم يعد لديه ما يعطيه لابشرية من *القيم* ، بل الذي لم يعد لديه ما يقنع ضميره باستحقاقه للوجود".
                <br><br>
                The translated version of the original text : 
                <br><br>
                "Mankind today is on the brink of a precipice, not because of the danger of complete annihilation which is hanging over its head-this being just a symptom and not the real disease -but because humanity is devoid of those vital *values* which are necessary not only for its healthy development but also for its real progress. Even the Western world realises that Western civilization is unable to present any healthy values for the guidance of mankind. It knows that it does not possess anything which will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence."
                <br><br>
                Islam's goal is to save humanity from the darkness , but most of them now either have been brainwashed, ignorant of truth or just refuse to see the truth. 
                <br><br>
                Mustapha Mahmoud was right when he said : 
                <br><br>
                نحن نعيش اليوم في عصر إلحاد حقيقي ومادية غبية اعمت الأبصار والبصائر. 
                <br><br>
                "We live now in a time of pure atheism, and a stupid materialism that has blinded the eyes and the hearts of people." 
                <br><br>
                So, when will we wake up from our own ignorance ? 
                <br><br>
                Ibn Taimiya says : 
                <br><br>
                القلوب المتعلقة بالشهوات محجوبة عن الله بقدر تعلقها بها.
                <br><br>
                "The hearts that are attached to the materialistic desires, are covered from Allah with regards to the extent of their attachment to those desires." 
                <br><br>
                And perhaps, this is why most people are so lost today, in their own darkness. 
                And there's a good saying : 
                <br><br>
                من ساء خلقه عذّب نفسه
                "He who lacks character, only tortures himself" 
                <br><br>
                Indeed, when one lacks manners, this one torments himself more than he does towards others. He or she punishes himself or herself through having a dark heart that is blind and a mind that is so shallow. 
                <br><br>
                With Islam, there is no fear, only inner tranquillity : 
                <br><br>
                من خاف الله أخاف الله منه كل شيء، ومن خاف الناس أخافه الله من كل شيء
                <br><br>
                "Whoever fears Allah, everything becomes afraid of him, and whoever fears people and does not fear Allah, will be afraid of everything" 
                <br><br>
                And this is the problem with the world today, some are too worried what others think of them and they worry so much if others like them and they lead fake and miserable lives through this tough process of torturing themselves. Allah doesn't care about your external beauty , he cares about how beautiful your heart is. 
                <br><br>
                And our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says about those who have good hearts : 
                <br><br>
                قلوبهم مثل أفئدة الطير 
                <br><br>
                "Their hearts are like those of birds" 
                <br><br>
                Which means that they are fearful of Allah, and those who fear Allah, love Allah. Therefore, their hearts hold no grudges or envy or hatred or arrogance. On the contrary, they are humble and kind and full of love and selflessness, and they always consider the presence of Allah. 
                <br><br>
                This kind of fear is positive , because it brings the believer closer to Allah and fills his or her heart with a never-ending inner peace.
                <br><br>
                Those who have such kind hearts, cry easily, laugh easily, and forgive easily.
                <br><br>
                And Having good manners is what strengthens our relationship with Allah : 
                <br><br>
                إن الله جعل مكارم الأخلاق ومحاسنها وصلا بيننا وبينه
                <br><br>
                "Allah has made these moral values to be a link between Him and us"</p>
