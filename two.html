                <h4 class="text-uppercase text-center p-5" > Part Two </h4>
              <p> Within Islam, we are free. We are protected. Well protected, we are divinely protected and always rewarded even for the smallest acts of kindness and goodness. Like, greeting someone with a genuine smile. 
                <br><br>
                All the rules that Allah has set for us as Muslims are for our own good and they show just how much love Allah has for us. Us, the usually ungrateful ones! Oh Allah forgive us. 
                <br><br>
                We, as Muslims, know that, for example, eating pork is forbidden or Haram حرام .. some of us, unfortunately, live according to their moods. Some do not eat pork, but they commit adultery ( Zina ). Some do not commit adultery, but they drink alcohol. Some never skip a prayer, but they do not pray sincerely and they lie endlessly. Some don't lie, but they hurt others when they are angry, they have no self-control. Some do not eat pork and do not commit adultery and do not drink alcohol and do not hurt others when angry, but they degrade others and are unconsciously arrogant. Some pray sincerely, but they gossip about and backbite other people. Some are too involved in the materialistic world that the only thing that makes them Muslims is the name " Muslim ". Some and some and some and many sins to mention. The list goes on. May Allah forgive us all and guide us to the right path.
                <br><br>
                We, human beings, never stop making mistakes, it's true. But this is not an excuse to keep repeating them. At least, we must not lose hope in Allah's infinite mercy. For, he forgives ALL sins. His mercy is always greater. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Az-zumar , verse 53 : 
                <br><br>
                قُلْ يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِن رَّحْمَةِ اللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ (53)
                <br><br>
                " Tell them, (O Prophet): “My servants who have committed excesses against themselves, do not despair of Allah's Mercy. Surely Allah forgives all sins. He is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful." 
                <br><br>
                But dear brother and dear sister, dear human, do you know what makes us different and above animals ? Exactly, it's our brains that think. But you know what is more particulary important ? Yes, it's having a good conscience. Conscience, my dear is a very big word. Not everyone has this quality; However! It's not hard to attain it and maintain it. Just keep practising and acknowledging the darkness in you. The best among us, my dear, are those who win the battle within themselves, the battle within their hearts and minds, to overcome the evil within. How to overcome your evil ? Always return to Allah, with all of your heart, and seek refuge in him. Just be sincere. He is always there for you, to help you grow and to help you be better when you truly are determined to become a true human being. 
                <br><br>
                You are a true Muslim, when you do all that you are obliged to do and get away from everything that is prohibited. 
                <br><br>
                Let Humanity be your biggest goal, to be a true human with noble qualities. No one is perfect of course and you may make mistakes but always get back up and stick to your conscience. 
                <br><br>
                For hatred, carry none in your heart. Let love and understanding, kindness and humility be in your heart. You are not ordinary, you are a Miracle. You have that brain so look around you and within you and observe the greatness of Allah. 
                <br><br>
                Let your soul be deeply attached to Allah 
                <br><br>
                Set yourself free from the chains of your biggest enemy wich is the ego, and fly higher in the clear and peaceful sky of good conscience, higher from all the dirt in the bottom  of sins. 
                <br><br>
                Never degrade anyone no matter how often they sin. Remember, no one is completely good, we are TRYING to be good.
                <br><br>
                Finally, dear, my dear, we are on this earth to be tested, and the greatest test we have during this era we live in is the test of how strong our Imaan or faith is in Allah. 
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Ankabut , verse 2 : 
                <br><br> 
                أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ (2)
                <br><br>
                " Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: “We believe” and not be tested? "
                <br><br>
                Allah says in Surah Al-Mulk, verse 2 : 
                <br><br>
                  الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ (2)
                  <br><br>
                  "Who ( Allah ) created death and life that He might try you as to which of you is better in deed. He is the Most Mighty, the Most Forgiving". 
                  <br><br>
                  Hudaifa Bnu Al Yaman was asked : when does a person know that he or she is being tested ? Then, Hudaifa replied : "when what he or she used to see as prohibited yesterday , becomes no longer considered prohibited today."
                  <br><br>
                  Our beloved prophet Muhammad peace be upon him says : there will come a time upon my Ummah, when the believer who holds onto his or her religion, will resemble that who holds onto a hot coal. 
                  <br><br>
                  The prophet Muhammad peace be upom him always used to say in his Dua : " O turner of hearts, let my heart remain firm on your religion." And He was told : " O prophet of Allah, we have believed in you and we have believed of the truth you brought us, so you are worried about us ? Then, the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said : "yes, the hearts are between two fingers of the fingers of Allah and He turns them however He wishes."
                  <br><br>
                  Stick to your faith, stick to Islam, it's your only home, stick to Allah, stick to your conscience. 
                  <br><br>
                  Be divine, because you are.
                  <br><br>
                  As a muslim, Allah has given you dignity and you are appreciated and loved unconditionally.</p>
